From the district summary, there are 15 schools and a total of 39,170 students. The average scores are: 79.0 for math and 85.8 for reading. 75.0% of students passed math, 85.8 passed reading, and 65.2% passed both.
From the school summary, there are noticable difference in the math and overall performance of charter schools compared with district schools. Charter schools had higher average math scores and higher math and overall passing rates. The reading scores and passing rates were slightly higher at charter schools that district schools, too. The student population at charter schools is lower than district schools as is the total school budget.
The five highest performing schools (based on overall % passing) were all charter schools, and the five lowest performing schools were all district schools.
The math scores do not appear to increase much per grade, regardless of school, and some schools decreased from 9th to 12th grade. The same appears true for reading scores.
An interesting note: when looking at average scores and pass rates compared with school spending (per student), the schools with the lowest per student spending tended to have the highest passing rates and slightly higher average scores in both subjects.
School size also appears to have an impact on scores and pass rates. Small and medium school outperformed large, most noticeably in average math scores and both math and overall passing rates.
In the final data frame comparing charter and district schools, the charter schools outperform district schools across the board.
